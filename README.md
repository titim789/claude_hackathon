# Investment Apprentice
## Your assistant that helps you understand companies quicker, form better investment decision
# 
### This app is designed for investment professionals - fund managers and analysts.
# 

It helps investment managers and analysts analyze earnings transcripts faster and make better decisions. The tool downloads transcripts of quarterly earnings calls by public companies. It then sends the text of these transcripts to Claude AI, which summarizes the key highlights, risks, and analyst concerns discussed on the calls. Claude also provides a sentiment rating for each company.
### 
Using Claude's outputs, managers and analysts can quickly compare companies against peers and see how their fundamentals are changing quarter to quarter. This helps them form judgments more quickly.  
###
Claude runs in the background, activated when new transcripts become available. Its results are stored in a database so the process does not have to repeat when users need information. This also reduces latency. 
###
The tool delivers results through a website and daily emails to users. Emails contain links to access the outputs on the site.

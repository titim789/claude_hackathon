Advertising growth is slowing.   \n\n\"Home Depot\": The company cited unfavorable weather, especially in western markets, and a pullback in big-ticket discretionary purchases by consumers.

However, the advertising business would likely face headwinds. AWS revenue growth is already slowing. A drop in consumer spending power could significantly impact Amazon.  \n\n\"Home Depot\": Home Depot is closely tied to the housing market and larger discretionary renovation projects, making the company vulnerable in a recession. However, home improvement retailers have historically proven defensive, and smaller DIY projects may continue even as spending slows. Sales of essential goods provide some downside protection.    \n}", "leadership": "{\n\"Walmart\": The discussion focused on managing costs and gaining operating efficiencies.
